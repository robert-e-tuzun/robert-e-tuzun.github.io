            <h2>About me</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
Hi.  My name is Robert E. Tuzun, and I write scientific/mathematical software
and develop scientific/mathematical algorithms.
Currently, I am a Scientist at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock
Division in Maryland, working in a Scrum-like environment to
fix bugs and add features to a mostly C++ multi-million
line suite of naval applications.
I am also a Research Assistant Professor
(voluntary) in the Department of Mathematics at the University at Buffalo,
continuing to
collaborate with my old Ph.D. advisor on computational knot theory research.
In addition to programming for more than the past 20 years, I have taught numerical methods, simulation and modeling, and scientific programming at the college level.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
My strongest language is C++11/14/17 (with Boost), in desktop and massively parallel environments, but I have also programmed in Java, Python, Matlab, Fortran, and other languages.   My software development of some quite complex applications, which has driven my research in computational chemistry and mathematics, has resulted in 35 peer-reviewed publications and two Ph.D.'s (chemistry and mathematics).  During my academic career, it also strongly contributed to my achievement of early promotion and tenure, by two years.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
In addition to my work at Carderock and Buffalo, I am constantly engaged in additional study projects.  My two current areas of study are topics in data science (data cleaning; languages and tools; and visualization and presentation) and agile/Scrum (I have recently earned a Certified Scrum Master certification).<br><br>
